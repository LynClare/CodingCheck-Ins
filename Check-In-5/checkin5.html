	<h2>  PREFACE.</h2>


	<p>  The present work is a modest effort to reproduce approximately, in modern
	  measures, the venerable epic, Beowulf. _Approximately_, I repeat; for a
	  very close reproduction of Anglo-Saxon verse would, to a large extent, be
	  prose to a modern ear.</p>

	  <p>The Heyne-Socin text and glossary have been closely followed. Occasionally
	  a deviation has been made, but always for what seemed good and sufficient
	  reason. The translator does not aim to be an editor. Once in a while,
	  however, he has added a conjecture of his own to the emendations quoted
	  from the criticisms of other students of the poem.</p>

	 <p> This work is addressed to two classes of readers. From both of these alike
	  the translator begs sympathy and co-operation. The Anglo-Saxon scholar he
	  hopes to please by adhering faithfully to the original. The student of
	  English literature he aims to interest by giving him, in modern garb, the
	  most ancient epic of our race. This is a bold and venturesome undertaking;
	  and yet there must be some students of the Teutonic past willing to follow
	  even a daring guide, if they may read in modern phrases of the sorrows of
	  Hrothgar, of the prowess of Beowulf, and of the feelings that stirred the
	  hearts of our forefathers in their primeval homes.</p>

	<p>  In order to please the larger class of readers, a regular cadence has been
	  used, a measure which, while retaining the essential characteristics of
	  the original, permits the reader to see ahead of him in reading.

	  Perhaps every Anglo-Saxon scholar has his own theory as to how Beowulf
	  should be translated. Some have given us prose versions of what we believe
	  to be a great poem. Is it any reflection on our honored Kemble and Arnold
	  to say that their translations fail to show a layman that Beowulf is
	  justly called our first _epic_? Of those translators who have used verse,
	  several have written from what would seem a mistaken point of view. Is it
	  proper, for instance, that the grave and solemn speeches of Beowulf and
	  Hrothgar be put in ballad measures, tripping lightly and airily along? Or,
	  again, is it fitting that the rough martial music of Anglo-Saxon verse be
	  interpreted to us in the smooth measures of modern blank verse? Do we hear
	  what has been beautifully called "the clanging tread of a warrior in
	  mail"?</p>

	<h3>  [viii]</h3>

	<p>  Of all English translations of Beowulf, that of Professor Garnett alone
	  gives any adequate idea of the chief characteristics of this great
	  Teutonic epic.

	  The measure used in the present translation is believed to be as near a
	  reproduction of the original as modern English affords. The cadences
	  closely resemble those used by Browning in some of his most striking
	  poems. The four stresses of the Anglo-Saxon verse are retained, and as
	  much thesis and anacrusis is allowed as is consistent with a regular
	  cadence. Alliteration has been used to a large extent; but it was thought
	  that modern ears would hardly tolerate it on every line. End-rhyme has
	  been used occasionally; internal rhyme, sporadically. Both have some
	  warrant in Anglo-Saxon poetry. (For end-rhyme, see 1_53, 1_54; for
	  internal rhyme, 2_21, 6_40.)</p>

	<p>  What Gummere[1] calls the "rime-giver" has been studiously kept; _viz._,
	  the first accented syllable in the second half-verse always carries the
	  alliteration; and the last accented syllable alliterates only
	  sporadically. Alternate alliteration is occasionally used as in the
	  original. (See 7_61, 8_5.)</p>

	<p>  No two accented syllables have been brought together, except occasionally
	  after a c√¶sural pause. (See 2_19 and 12_1.)</p><p> Or, scientifically speaking,
	  Sievers's C type has been avoided as not consonant with the plan of
	  translation. Several of his types, however, constantly occur; _e.g._ A and
	  a variant (/ x | / x) (/ x x | / x); B and a variant (x / | x / ) (x x / |
	  x / ); a variant of D (/ x | / x x); E (/ x x | / ).</p>
	  
	  <p> Anacrusis gives
	  further variety to the types used in the translation.

	  The parallelisms of the original have been faithfully preserved. (_E.g._,
	  1_16 and 1_17: "Lord" and "Wielder of Glory"; 1_30, 1_31, 1_32; 2_12 and
	  2_13; 2_27 and 2_28; 3_5 and 3_6.)</p>
	  <p> Occasionally, some loss has been
	  sustained; but, on the other hand, a gain has here and there been made.

	  The effort has been made to give a decided flavor of archaism to the
	  translation. All words not in keeping with the spirit of the poem have
	  been avoided. Again, though many archaic words have been used, there are
	  none, it is believed, which are not found in standard modern poetry.

	</p> <h3> [ix]</h3>

	 <p> With these preliminary remarks, it will not be amiss to give an outline of
	  the story of the poem.</p>
